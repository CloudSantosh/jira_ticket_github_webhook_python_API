## GitHub Jira Integration using Python Flask (DevOps Project) üëã

<img src="https://github.com/CloudSantosh/jira_ticket_github_webhook_python_API/blob/main/image/project_concept.png" >

The project involves building and deploying Jira ticket application using python flask via webhook. Here are components involved:

### üí¨ Developers:

When developers comment on the issue using keyword /jira in the text box.

### üí¨ Github:

Github send complete information as payload to the Python API hosted on EC2 instance via webhook.

### üí¨ EC2 instance hosting API python Application:

EC2 instances using flask to run the python script as an application.

### üí¨ Jira:

Jira is a software application developed by the Australian software company Atlassian that allows teams to track issues, manage projects, and automate workflows. Jira is based on four key concepts: issue, project, board and workflow.

- Issue üë©‚Äçüíª

An issue is a single work item you track from creation to completion. An issue could be a bug, a user story, an epic, a to-do item for an HR team, or an artifact that your documentation team needs to create.

- Projects üë©‚Äçüíª

A project is a way to group your issues along with the common information and context that tie those issues together. You can configure issues associated with a project in a variety of ways, including visibility restrictions and applicable workflows.

- Boards üë©‚Äçüíª

A board in Jira is a visual representation of your team‚Äôs workflow within a project. You can use multiple boards for flexible ways to view, manage, and report on work in progress on the same project. If you use an agile approach, you may find it helpful to use a Kanban Board view to track backlog items as they refine and a Sprint Board to show the Sprint Backlog for your current sprint.

- Workflows üë©‚Äçüíª

A workflow represents the path that issues take as they progress through your project from creation to completion. Each label in a workflow, such as To Do, In Progress, and Done, represent a status that an issue can take. You can configure workflows to govern the transitions an issue can take between different statuses and trigger actions that occur when an issue moves into a status.

In this project we use issue tracking where python flask application makes API call to Jira to create Jira ticket on the board based on comments made by developers on github issues.

# üöÄ Part 1

## Developers Comment on Issue on Github

Here developers make comment on the issue with the keyword /Jira with detail information about the issue.

# üöÄ PART-3

This Python script is a Flask web application that serves as a GitHub webhook receiver. When a GitHub webhook event is received, specifically an issue comment event, the application checks for certain keywords in the comment. If any of the specified keywords ("/jira", "/Jira", or "/JIRA") are found, it triggers the creation of a corresponding issue in Jira.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing Libraries:**

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
   import json
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os
   import requests
   ```

   The script imports the necessary libraries: Flask for creating a web application, request for handling HTTP requests, jsonify for creating JSON responses, HTTPBasicAuth for HTTP basic authentication, json for working with JSON data, dotenv for loading environment variables, os for interacting with the operating system, and requests for making HTTP requests.

2. **Create Flask App:**

   ```python
   app = Flask(__name__)
   ```

   The Flask application is created with the name `app`.

3. **Load Environment Variables:**

   ```python
   load_dotenv()
   ```

   The `load_dotenv()` function is used to load environment variables from a file named `.env`.

4. **Set Jira Credentials:**

   ```python
   jira_email = os.environ.get('JIRA_EMAIL')
   jira_api_token = os.environ.get('JIRA_API_TOKEN')
   jira_base_url = "https://santoshtechguyjira.atlassian.net"
   ```

   The Jira credentials (email and API token) and base URL are loaded from environment variables.

5. **Set Jira Project and Issue Type:**

   ```python
   jira_project_key = "TP"
   jira_issue_type = "10006"
   ```

   The Jira project key and issue type are specified. Project_key is the First letter of each words. Issue type: Bug(10008), Epic(10009), Story(10006), Task(10007) and subtask(10010)

6. **Define a Route for GitHub Webhook:**

   ```python
   @app.route("/github_webhook", methods=['POST'])
   ```

   This line defines a route for the "/github_webhook" endpoint, and it specifies that the route should only respond to HTTP POST requests.

7. **GitHub Webhook Handling Function:**

   ```python
   def github_webhook():
   ```

   This function is executed when a POST request is made to the "/github_webhook" endpoint.

8. **Parse GitHub Webhook Payload:**

   ```python
   payload = request.json
   ```

   The incoming JSON payload from the GitHub webhook is parsed.

9. **Check for Issue Comment:**

   ```python
   if 'issue' in payload and 'comment' in payload:
   ```

   It checks if the payload contains information about an issue and a comment.

10. **Check for Jira Keywords in Comment:**

    ```python
    if any(keyword in issue_comment for keyword in jira_keywords):
    ```

    It checks if any of the specified keywords ("/jira", "/Jira", "/JIRA") are present in the issue comment.

11. **Call Function to Create Jira Issue:**

    ```python
    create_jira_issue(payload)
    ```

12. **Return Webhook Response:**

    ```python
    return jsonify({'message': 'Webhook received successfully'}), 200
    ```

    A JSON response is returned indicating that the webhook was received successfully.

13. **Function to Create Jira Issue:**

    ```python
    def create_jira_issue(payload):
    ```

    This function is responsible for creating a new issue in Jira.

14. **Jira API URL and Authentication:**

    ```python
    url = f"{jira_base_url}/rest/api/3/issue"
    auth = HTTPBasicAuth(jira_email, jira_api_token)
    ```

    The Jira API URL and authentication details are set up.

15. **Headers and Payload for Jira Issue:**

    ```python
    headers = {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    jira_payload = {
        # ... (JSON data for creating a new Jira issue)
    }
    ```

16. **Make a POST Request to Jira API:**

    ```python
    response = requests.request(
        "POST",
        url,
        json=jira_payload,
        headers=headers,
        auth=auth
    )
    ```

    A POST request is made to the Jira API using the `requests` library, with the specified URL, payload, headers, and authentication.

17. **Return JSON Response:**

    ```python
    return jsonify(json.loads(response.text)), 200
    ```

    The JSON response from the Jira API is returned.

18. **Run the Flask App:**
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run('0.0.0.0', port=5000)
    ```
    The script checks whether it is being run directly (`__name__ == '__main__'`) and, if so, starts the Flask web application on the specified host and port (0.0.0.0:5000). This makes the web service accessible externally.

In summary, this script creates a Flask web service that acts as a GitHub webhook receiver. When it receives a webhook event related to an issue comment and detects specific keywords, it triggers the creation of a corresponding issue in Jira.
